You are expected to solve 5 different problems using shell programs. The problems must be related to topics discussed
in class - related to files and text-substitution or processes e.t.c. They can be as simple as a one liner to any 
degree of complexity.

They must be about automation of some activity that you would do manually. They must not be related to abstract things
not related to daily computer use - say solving some mathematical problem or something.

Remember, in real life, coming up with right problems to solve is as important as coming up with a solution.
If you cannot solve it, someone else may solve it for you. Better to solve right problem wrongly than wrong problem rightly.


Submission Instructions:
1.Make 5 different script files having names script1.sh to script5.sh.
2.Make a ”readme.txt” which contains your 5 problem statements corresponding to your script number. Your problem statement must not be only technical. It must also describe your own life-experience where the problem arose. 

For example, my backup script, I may say that

"After losing my correctly working code after making several changes - I decided to manually make a backup copy of my code frequently. Hence I wrote a script whose details are:

Input:...

Output:...

"



3.Also specify the execution commands to run your script in readme file.
Eg:
>>./script1.sh <parameters>.
4.If your shell script contains an input file specify that in readme file and also
add those file in a separate folder by name of ”input” so that script can be
executed using this command
>>./script1.sh input/
