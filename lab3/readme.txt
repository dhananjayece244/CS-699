Python Regular Expression
Your task is to anonymize all the phone numbers and email addresses in a given file. That is, you have to do the following:

a) Open a file

b) Find all phone numbers and email addresses in it

c) replace them with suitably masked strings

d) write them back to a new file

You should do this by solving simpler problems first. 

1) Figure out how to read, write, open files etc. Write a program to simply copy a file line-by-line.

2) Create two regular expressions using the 're' module - one for phone number, other for email addresses

3) Print the matching lines in input file. Find all matches, not just the first one in each line. Maybe just do the phone number or email address first. Once that works, then move to other.

4) Figure out how to do string substitution with regular expressions.

5) Display some kind of summary statistics for the file.

At the end of the lab, you must make a submission stating how far have you reached among above 5 steps. After that you will get time till tomorrow 8pm to finish the assignment.

For the finished assignment, you should also thing of 3 other types of regular expressions - besides phone number and email addresses, say some kind of errors in documents, and you should correct those errors.
